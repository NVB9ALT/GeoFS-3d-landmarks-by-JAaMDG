# GeoFS-3d-landmarks-by-JAaMDG

This adds 3d landmarks to GeoFS. This is not my addon, this is an addon made by JAaMDG. It's a much older version of the current 3d buildings addon in development, and is much more limited. The original addon (optimized for Tampermonkey) can be found here: https://github.com/Lil-Triper/GeoFS-3D-Landmarks

These are the structures that it adds:
- USS Intrepid (decoration purposes only)
- JFK ATC
- LAX ATC
- LHR ATC
- CDG ATC
- SFO ATC
- MIA ATC
- One World Trade Center
- Gateway Arch
- Sydney Opera House
- The Shard
- Space Needle
- The Gherkin
- Big Ben
- Leaning Tower of Pisa
- The Compass (fictional)

Please note that this only works in GeoFS version 2.9 or earlier versions. It does not work in GeoFS 3.0 or later versions.

The code is provided in bookmarklet format. To run this, you follow the following procedure:

- Copy the code
- Click the little star icon at the right end of your search bar to make a bookmark
- Click "more"
- Type "GeoFS 3d landmarks" in the "Name" box
- Paste the code into the "URL" space
- Click "save"
- Click the bookmark when running GeoFS to run it.

If the bookmarks bar is not visible when playing GeoFS, right click any bookmark and click "Show bookmarks bar" at the very bottom of the popup menu.

There are a number of other GeoFS addons that can be run as bookmarklets, so it is recommended to make a bookmarks folder of GeoFS addons if you are planning on using multiple of them.
